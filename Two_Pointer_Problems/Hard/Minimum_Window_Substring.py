# Minimum Window Substring

# Problem Statement:
# Given strings s and t, return the smallest substring of s that contains all the characters of t.
# If there is no such substring, return an empty string.

# Example:

# Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"  
# Output: "BANC"


# Python Code:

from collections import Counter

def minWindow(s, t):
    if not t or not s:
        return ""
    dict_t = Counter(t)
    required = len(dict_t)
    l, r = 0, 0
    formed = 0
    window_counts = {}
    ans = float("inf"), None, None

    while r < len(s):
        char = s[r]
        window_counts[char] = window_counts.get(char, 0) + 1
        if char in dict_t and window_counts[char] == dict_t[char]:
            formed += 1

        while l <= r and formed == required:
            if r - l + 1 < ans[0]:
                ans = (r - l + 1, l, r)
            window_counts[s[l]] -= 1
            if s[l] in dict_t and window_counts[s[l]] < dict_t[s[l]]:
                formed -= 1
            l += 1
        r += 1

    return "" if ans[0] == float("inf") else s[ans[1]: ans[2] + 1]
