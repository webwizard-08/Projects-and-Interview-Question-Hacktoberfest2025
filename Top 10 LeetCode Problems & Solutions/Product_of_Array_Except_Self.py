#        Product of Array Except Self
# ==================================================
"""
Problem Statement:
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

"""
Constraints:
2 <= nums.length <= 105
-30 <= nums[i] <= 30
The input is generated such that answer[i] is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.                    
"""

#Explanation:
# First loop builds prefix product.
# Second loop multiplies suffix product.

#Solution:
def productExceptSelf(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    res = [1] * n
    prefix = 1
    for i in range(n):
        res[i] = prefix
        prefix *= nums[i]
    suffix = 1
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        res[i] *= suffix
        suffix *= nums[i]
    return res

Output: [24,12,8,6]

Example 2:
